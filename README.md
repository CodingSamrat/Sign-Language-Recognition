# Sign language Recognition

**Abstract:** Sign language is a visual means of communicating through hand signals, gestures, facial expressions, and body language. It's the main form of communication for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community, but sign language can be useful for other groups of people as well.
The project aims to build a machine learning model that will be able to classify the various hand gestures used for finger spelling in sign language. In this user independent model, classification machine learning algorithms are trained using a set of image data and testing is done on a completely different set of data.
